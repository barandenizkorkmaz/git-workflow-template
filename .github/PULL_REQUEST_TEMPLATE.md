# Review Progress (Reviewer)
<!-- Each Pull Request should be reviewed by at least two other developers. The code, the functionality (= manual test) and the exam mode need to be reviewed. -->
<!-- The reviewer or author check the following boxes depending on what was reviewed or tested. All boxes should be checked before merge. -->
<!-- You can add additional checkboxes if it makes sense to only review parts of the code or functionality. -->
<!-- When changes are pushed, uncheck the affected boxes. (Not all changes require full re-reviews.) -->
<!-- All PRs that might affect the exam mode (e.g. change a client component that is also used in the exam mode) need an additional verification that the exam mode still works. -->
